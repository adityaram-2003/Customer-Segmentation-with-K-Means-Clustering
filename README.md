### Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering

This repository contains code to perform customer segmentation using K-Means clustering. Customer segmentation is a crucial task for businesses aiming to understand their customers better and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

#### Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is the "Mall Customers" dataset, which contains information about customers' gender, age, annual income, and spending score.

#### Contents
- **Data Exploration:** Initial exploration of the dataset to understand the distribution of key variables such as annual income, age, and spending score.
- **Visualization:** Visualizations including histograms and scatterplots to gain insights into the relationships between different variables.
- **K-Means Clustering:** Implementation of K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers based on their annual income and spending score. Elbow method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- **3D Visualization:** Visualization of clustered data in a 3D plot to visualize the clusters formed based on age, annual income, and spending score.
- **Customer Group Analysis:** Identification and analysis of each customer group generated by the clustering algorithm.

#### Files
- **customer_segmentation.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, visualization, and K-Means clustering.
- **Mall_Customers.csv:** Dataset used for analysis.

#### Instructions
1. Ensure you have Python and necessary libraries installed (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open and run the `KMeans Clustering Code.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter environment.

#### Results
The K-Means clustering algorithm successfully segmented customers into distinct groups based on their annual income and spending score. Each group represents a different segment of customers with unique characteristics.

#### Conclusion
Customer segmentation provides valuable insights for businesses to understand their customer base better and tailor marketing strategies to meet specific customer needs. This analysis enables businesses to target different customer segments effectively, leading to improved customer satisfaction and business growth.
